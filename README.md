Awesome Assets on Blockchain Sharding Systems

## Introduction
- Sharding aims at dividng the nodes into nodes into different consensus groups that process transactions concurrently.
- A transaction may involve a single shard (called intrashard transaction) or multiple shards (called cross-shard transaction).
- To process cross-shard transactions, nodes in different shards may communicate with each other.

## Important Layers
- Data Layer :  defines how the ledger is formatted and divided into different shards
- Membership Layer : defines how nodes are allocated to different shards.
- Intra Shard Layer : defines how each shard processes local transactions. 
- Cross Shard Layer : defines how shards process cross-shard transactions.
